pcm2pwm 0.7 - a utility for 1-bit audio weirdos   // code by:  jeffalyanak@gmail.com
===========================================     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pcm2pwm is a simply utility for converting 8-bit PCM wave audio into a delta PWM byte stream.
It's output is intended for use with any 1-bit audio devices which require a simple playback
routine or relatively high degree of compression.


Running the utility
-------------------
pcm2pwm is currently an extremely limited tool. It will reject formats it cannot read, feed it
only mono 8-bit wave files. Audacity is a great, multi-platform tool for preparing your audio
(see section below) and will allow you to export in this format. Basic use is simple just run
the tool and hand it a filename:

$ pcm2pwm input.wav

The pcm2pwm tool will output to standard output, so if you'd like to save the output
to a file, just use:

$ pcm2pwm input.wav > output.txt

Additionally, you may specify two values to act as the high and low crossovers as well. These
values must be between 255 and 0. For example:

$ pcm2pwm input.wav 240 15

This would trigger the high and low states slightly earlier and might be useful if your input
wav file isn't very loud. Moving these two values too close or too far from your average
amplitude will ruin timbre of the resulting output sound. Experiment to see what works best.

You may also add the -h option before the input file to toggle an inverted output format
suitable for Houston Tracker 2.

$ pcm2pwm -h input.wav <...>

Preparing your input audio
--------------------------
With the addition - in version 0.5 - of custom high and low crossovers, a wider range of
audio can be run through the pcm2pwm tool. However, the following advice may still return
the best results:

  The input audio must be compressed, limited or otherwise overdriven in order to keep 
  most of the samples below 3 and above 252 (basically, you want it to be clipping or
  nearly clipping as much as possible. The easiest way to do this is to use an audio
  program like audacity to heavily amplify your your audio with the "allow clipping"
  box ticked. If you know what you're doing with audio then you already know the tricks
  for maximizing your output "loudness", do this to the extreme.


Using the output
----------------
Each output byte represents the number of samples since a zero-crossover. That is
to say, it's the number of samples since a state change. The output sample-rate will
match the input sample-rate, therefor a 11024Hz wav will produce byte data based on
the same reference rate. If your playback routine is faster or slower than this rate,
the pitch/speed of the resulting audio will be altered.


Playback routine
----------------
If you're even thinking of using this utility you probably already know what you want
to use it for but here's an extremely simple explanation of what you need your playback
routine to do:

-read byte
-wait that many samples length of time (your playback routine may be slightly faster or
slower given limitations of limited processors)
-toggle state
-read next byte
-etc

Pretty simple, eh!

Version History
----------------

0.2 - Basic functionality
0.5 - Added the ability to set high and low crossover values.
0.7 - pcm2pwm now checks the input file's header to ensure compatibility.
0.8 - Added the -h option for outputting in a Houston Tracker 2 format.
